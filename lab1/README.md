Now let's train a classifier to classify security vulnerabilities according to their CVSS severity class. The dataset provided below contains the CVSS features and severity for all of the vulnerabilities reported in 2020. The vulnerabilities are separated in four severity classes:

0 = 'LOW'
1 = 'MIDDLE'
2 = 'HIGH'
3 = 'CRITICAL'
